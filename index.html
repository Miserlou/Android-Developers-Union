<h2>The Android Developers Union</h2>
</section>

<section id="intro">
<p>
		&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; We, the members and supporters of the Android Developers Union, are fed up with the conditions of the
		Android Market. We are tired of being treated like sharecroppers on Google's digital plantation! 
		We have compiled a list of <b>seven demands</b> which Google can implement to improve the
		Market. Implementing these demands will absolutely improve the working conditions for Android
		developers, thereby improving the Android ecosystem and giving a better experience to our customers.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If our demands are not met, we will move our applications to alternative marketplaces or the web,
cease Android development in favor of other more open platforms, we will dissuade other developers from developing 
Android projects, and we will work tirelessly to counter any of Google's hypocritical claims
about Openness in the media.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These are our demands! They are simple and they are attainable, so we hope that Google will do
the right thing!

	<tr><th>Demand:</th><th>Has Google Complied?</th></tr>
	<tr><td>
	<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link1'>Renegotiation of the 32% Google-tax on applications sales<img src="arrow.png"></a>
	<div class="hidden" id='link1'>
				<p>32% of all application sales revenue is currently taken by Google, some of which goes to them,
				some of which goes to the telco carrier of the customer. Either way, it is large expense for 
				which neither the developer nor the customer receive any value for. Even iPhone developers, who
				pay a similar tax to Apple, receive value for their tax in the form of Market curation. We get
				nothing.</p>

				<p>We demand that Google renegotiate this rate, either to a much lower percentage (preferably, no
				percentage) or give us some value for our money in terms of Market curation and support.</p>

		</div></td><td>No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>

	<tr><td class="two">
		<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link2'>Remedy to the Order of Entry Effect<img src="arrow.png"></a>
		<div class="hidden" id='link2'>
				<p>The Android Market only has two ways to browse: Most Recent and Top Selling. The Most Recent list
				is constantly being updated and a new application is only in the top few spots of the list for a
				minute at most. The Top Selling list goes back all the way to the beginning of the Android Market,
				so only the applications which have been around for years already can be at the top of the list.
				This leaves no room for organic growth of a new application. This Order of Entry Effect was also one of the main reasons
				that "Facebook Applications" were considered a failure.
				</p>
				<p> We demand that Google implement a way
				to browse for popular applications of different lengths of time and for different regions.
				</p>
	</td><td class="two">No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>
	
<tr><td >
	<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link3'>Public Bug Tracking<img src="arrow.png"></a>
	<div class="hidden" id='link3'>
				<p>The Android Market has been, and still is, consistently plagued with technical problems. Also, despite the 
				Open philosophy which Google champions in Android, the Market application is closed source,
				non-Free software. This combination means that although we as developers and customers have to deal with the
				crippling bugs of the Market on a daily basis, and yet we have no way to remedy them.

				<p>We would like to see the Android Market open sourced, but if this is not possible, then we demand that at least
				the bug tracking for the client and the server software of the Android Market be done on a public bug tracker,
				so that we may report errors and highlight the errors which we feel are the most pressing.

		</div></td><td>No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>

	<tr><td class="two">
		<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link4'>Increased Payment Options<img src="arrow.png"></a>
		<div class="hidden" id='link4'>
				<p>For the first two years the Android Market operated, Google's own Checkout service was the only form of payment
				available to customers. This has changed in some places, and some are now able to pay with other methods. However,
				this isn't enough.

				<p>We demand increased payment methods, particularly a Web or Desktop based interface to the Market, as well as a
				way for developers to implement "Pay What You Want" pricing schemes.
	
	</td><td class="two">No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>

	<tr><td >
	<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link5'>Codified Rules and a Removal Appeal Process<img src="arrow.png"></a>
	<div class="hidden" id='link5'>
				<p>The current Market provides only very vague guidelines about what is and isn't acceptable content on the market.
				Many developers have had their applications removed without warning, without notice and without explanation. These
				rejections have come with no method of appeal.

				<p>We demand that Google strictly codify the rules of the Market, and that any removals must be accompanied with a complete
				explanation and reference to the specific rules violated, and with a formal method for appeal.

		</div></td><td>No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>
	
	<tr><td class="two">
		<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link6'>Communication and Engineering Liaison<img src="arrow.png"></a>
		<div class="hidden" id='link6'>
				<p>The feedback loop of the Android Market is broken. Google changes the conditions of the Market without any public
				planning and without soliciting any feedback from the developer community.

				<p>We demand that Google fix the communication problems between developers and their own Market team by assigning a
				communication and engineering liaison who will respond to public and private issues with the Market, solicit feedback
				from the developer community, and make periodic public statements regarding the state and the future of the Market.
	
	</td><td class="two">No!<img src="redx.png"></td></tr>
	
	<tr><td >
	<a class="dropdownable" href="" data-div-id='link7'>Algorithmic Transparency<img src="arrow.png"></a>
	<div class="hidden" id='link7'>
				<p>Because the Market source code is closed, there are many mysteries about the way the Market behaves. The search function
				behaves mysteriously, some updates mean that an app is reposted to the "Most Recent" list and some do not, comment flagging 
				appears to do nothing at all, and there is a list of Featured Apps, the content of which is usually stagnant and unexplained.

				<p>We demand that Google explain the algorithms behind these features so that we may more thoroughly understand our own 
				working conditions and the needs of our customers. If the Featured list is decided with human intervention and not 
				algorithmically, we demand that there be a community representative on the committee deciding which apps should be Featured.
